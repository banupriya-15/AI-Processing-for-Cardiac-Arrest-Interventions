# Temporal Trends and Survival Determinants in Capnography: A Machine Learning Study  

## Overview  
This project explores the **predictive potential of End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide (EtCO₂) capnography** in cardiac resuscitation using **machine learning models**. By analyzing **temporal trends in EtCO₂** and patient responses to **epinephrine administration**, the study identifies critical **survival determinants** for **Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC)**.

## Key Features  
- ** Data-Driven Insights:** Analyzes the relationship between **EtCO₂ trends** and **cardiac resuscitation outcomes**.  
- ** Machine Learning Models:** Implements **Random Forest and Logistic Regression** to predict **ROSC**.  
- ** Flask Application:** Provides a streamlined **data processing tool** for healthcare professionals.  
- ** Feature Engineering:** Computes **EtCO₂ slope, peak time, duration, and proportional changes**.  
- ** Real-Time Decision Support:** Enables **AI-powered clinical insights** for improved resuscitation strategies.

## Methodology  

### 1 Data Processing  
- Uses **Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART) dataset** with patient demographics and EtCO₂ readings.  
- Cleans and structures data for **ML modeling**.  

### 2 Feature Engineering  
- Computes **EtCO₂ slope** to evaluate capnography trends.  
- Extracts **epinephrine response metrics** such as **T_lag, T_peak, and T_duration**.  

### 3 Machine Learning Modeling  
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Achieves **90% accuracy, AUC 0.96**.  
- **Logistic Regression:** Serves as a baseline with **85% accuracy**.  
- **Odds Ratio & Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies key predictors of **ROSC**.  

### 4 Flask Application  
- **Live Data Processing Tool:** Converts **medical waveform data** into ML-ready datasets.  
- **Real-time Predictions:** Enables clinicians to assess survival probabilities based on **EtCO₂ trends**.
